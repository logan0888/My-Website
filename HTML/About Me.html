           My name is Logan and I'm currently teaching myself how to program. This website is actually my first time doing anything with code and this whole site here was made by hand over the course of many days filled with learning, making mistakes, and ajusting as I felt necessary. My main goal with this is to become experienced in multiple programming languages, creating cool projects, and sharing my results and general information with everyone. 
       </p>
       <p class="my-information-p2">
           I will strive to update this site regularly and document most, if not all of my learings. If you have any feedback or sugestions on what I could make or work on, don't hesitate to ask me, you can reach me via instagram through the My Social Media section of this site.
